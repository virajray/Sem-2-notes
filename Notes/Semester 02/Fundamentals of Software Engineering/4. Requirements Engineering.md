### <font color="#00ffab">What is a Requirement?</font>
<font color="#ffc000">it is a detailed, formal definition of a system function.</font>

### <font color="#00c3ff">Types of Requirements</font>

##### 1.User requirements 
Statements in natural language plus diagrams of the services the system provides and its operational constraints. Written for customers. 
##### 2.System requirements 
A structured document setting out detailed descriptions of the system’s functions, services and operational constraints. Defines what should be implemented so may be part of a contract between client and contractor.

### <font color="#00ffab">Functional & Non-Functional Requirements</font>
##### <font color="#ffc000">1.Functional requirements </font>(what the system should do)
- Defines the services the system should provide
- Specifies how the system should respond to specific inputs
- Describes the system's behavior in various situations
- May include restrictions on what the system should not do
<font color="#ffff00">Example:</font>
- **Requirement**: The system must allow users to create an account.
- **Explanation**: Users should be able to register for an account on the platform.
##### <font color="#ffc000">2.Non-functional requirements</font> (how the system performs a certain function)
- Specifies constraints on the services or functions provided by the system
- Includes timing constraints, development process constraints, standards adherence, etc.
- Typically applies to the system as a whole rather than individual features or services
<font color="#ffff00">Example:</font>
- **Requirement**: The system must have a response time of less than 500 milliseconds.
- **Explanation**: The system should respond to user actions within half a second to ensure a smooth user experience.




### <font color="#ff6000">Classification of Non-Functional Requirements</font>

##### <font color="#ffff00">Product requirements</font>
These are the specifications and features that the product or system must have to meet the needs of its users.
- **<font color="#92d050">Example</font>**:
    - For a messaging app, product requirements may include the ability to send text, images, and videos, as well as features like group messaging and read receipts.
##### <font color="#ffff00">Organizational requirements</font>
These are the rules, processes, or standards set by the organization developing or using the product.
- **<font color="#92d050">Example</font>**:
    - An organizational requirement for a software development team might be to follow a specific coding standard or to conduct regular code reviews.
##### <font color="#ffff00">External requirements</font>
These are requirements imposed by external entities such as laws, regulations, industry standards, or third-party services.
- **<font color="#92d050">Example</font>**:
    - An external requirement for an e-commerce website may be compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR or PCI DSS

# <font color="#00c3ff">Requirements Engineering Processes</font>

Requirements engineering involves three key activities 
1. <font color="#00ffab">Requirements elicitation and analysis</font> • Discover requirements by interacting with stakeholders
2. <font color="#00ffab">Requirements Specification</font> • converting these requirements into a standard form 
3. <font color="#00ffab">Requirements Validation</font> • checking that the requirements actually define the system that the customer wants
## <font color="#00ffab">1. Requirements elicitation and analysis</font>
Requirements elicitation is the process of gathering, discovering, and understanding what stakeholders need from a product or system.

It's like asking questions and listening carefully to find out what people want from a project.

**<font color="#ffc000">Example</font>**:
- Imagine you're planning a surprise party for a friend. You'd ask them questions like "What kind of party would you like?" and "Who would you want to invite?" 
- to understand their preferences and needs. Similarly, in requirements elicitation, you ask stakeholders questions to understand what features and functions they need in a product or system.

#### <font color="#ff6000">Problems of Requirements Elicitation and Analysis </font>
•Stakeholders don’t know what they really want. 
•Stakeholders express requirements in their own terms. 
•Different stakeholders may have conflicting requirements. 
•Organizational and political factors may influence the system requirements. 
•The requirements change during the analysis process. New stakeholders may emerge and the business environment may change.

#### <font color="#00c3ff">Requirements Elicitation Techniques </font>
•There are two fundamental approaches to requirements elicitation: 
1. <font color="#00c3ff">Interviewing</font> • where you talk to people about what they do. 
2. <font color="#00c3ff">Observation</font> or ethnography • where you watch people doing their job to see what artifacts they use, how they use them, and so on.
