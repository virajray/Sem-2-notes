# Scrum

three pillars of Scrum are:

- **Transparency**: 
- **Inspection**: 
- **Adaptation**: 

**Roles:**

1. **Product Owner**: Defines the product backlog, prioritizes features, and ensures the team delivers value to the customer.
2. **Scrum Master**: Facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and ensures the team follows Scrum practices.
3. **Development Team**: Executes the work, creating increments of the product during each Sprint.

**Events:**

1. **Sprint**: A time-boxed period (usually 2-4 weeks) where a usable and potentially releasable product increment is created.
2. **Sprint Planning**: The team and Product Owner plan the work for the Sprint.
3. **Daily Scrum**: A short, daily meeting for the team to synchronize and plan the next 24 hours.
4. **Sprint Review**: A meeting at the end of the Sprint to review what was completed and gather feedback.
5. **Sprint Retrospective**: A meeting for the team to reflect on the Sprint and identify improvements.

**Artifacts:**

1. **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of features, enhancements, and fixes needed for the product.
2. **Sprint Backlog**: A list of tasks and goals selected from the Product Backlog for the current Sprint.
3. **Increment**: The sum of all completed Product Backlog items during a Sprint, plus all previous increments.
