## Checklist ✅

#### incremental software development
#### Process improvement
- **Process Measurement**: 
	Collecting data and metrics to evaluate the performance of a process.
- **Process Analysis**:
- **Process Design/Redesign**: 
    might involve reengineering workflows, introducing new tools or technologies, or changing organizational structures.
- **Process Standardization**: 
    Establishing standardized procedures and best practices to ensure consistency and predictability in process execution.
- **Process Implementation**: 
    Putting new or revised processes into practice, including training staff, configuring systems, and rolling out changes across the organization.
- **Process Monitoring and Control**: 
	Continuously tracking process performance against defined metrics 
- **Process Documentation**: 
    Documenting processes in detail, including steps, responsibilities, and metrics
- **Process Optimization**: 
    Refining and fine-tuning processes to achieve optimal performance
- **Process Change Management**: 
    Managing the transition to new processes
- **Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)**: 
    Encouraging ongoing, incremental improvements by empowering employees at all levels to identify and implement enhancements.
- **Benchmarking**:
	-  Comparing processes and performance metrics against industry standards 

## Spiral agile nemeiii ⚠

## In XP Programming
- requirements are recorded on story cards.
- an automated unit test framework is used in writing tests even before starting implementation.
- developers are expected to refactor the code continuously.
