### 1. **System Modeling Overview**

- **Purpose**: Developing abstract models to represent different views or perspectives of a system.
- **Commonly Used Notation**: Unified Modeling Language (UML).

### 2. **Existing and Planned System Models**

- **Existing Models**: Used during requirements engineering to understand current system functions and identify strengths and weaknesses.
- **Planned Models**: Help explain proposed requirements and document system design for implementation.

### 3. **System Perspectives**

- **External Perspective**: Models the system's context or environment.
- **Interaction Perspective**: Models interactions between the system and its environment or components.
- **Structural Perspective**: Models the system's organization or data structure.
- **Behavioral Perspective**: Models the system's dynamic behavior and responses to events.

### 4. **UML Diagram Types**

- **Activity Diagrams**: Show activities in a process or data processing.
- **Use Case Diagrams**: Show interactions between the system and its environment.
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Illustrate interactions between actors and system components.
- **Class Diagrams**: Display object classes and associations.
- **State Diagrams**: Depict system reactions to internal and external events.

### 5. **Graphical Models Usage**

- **Facilitate Discussion**: Useful for discussing existing or proposed systems, even if incomplete.
- **Document Systems**: Can accurately represent system details.
- **System Description**: Used for generating system implementations, requiring accuracy and completeness.

### 6. **Context Models**

- **Purpose**: Illustrate the operational context and boundaries of a system.
- **System Boundaries**: Define what is inside and outside the system, affecting requirements and organizational decisions.

### 7. **Interaction Models**

- **User Interaction Modeling**: Identifies user requirements.
- **System-to-System Interaction**: Highlights communication issues.
- **Component Interaction**: Assesses system structure performance and dependability.

### 8. **Structural Models**

- **Static and Dynamic Models**: Represent system design and execution structure.
- **Class Diagrams**: Used in object-oriented models to show classes and associations.
- **Generalization**: Manages complexity by grouping similar entities.

### 9. **Behavioral Models**

- **Dynamic Behavior**: Show system responses to stimuli (data or events).
- **Data-Driven Models**: Focus on data processing sequences.
- **Event-Driven Models**: Focus on system responses to events.
- **State Machine Models**: Represent states and transitions in response to stimuli.

### 10. **Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)**

- **Approach**: Uses models as principal outputs, with automatic code generation.
- **Pros and Cons**: Raises abstraction level but may not always be suitable for implementation.

### 11. **Model-Driven Architecture (MDA)**

- **Concept**: Uses UML models to describe systems at different abstraction levels, potentially generating working programs.

### 12. **Summary**

- Models provide abstract views of systems, showing context, interactions, structure, and behavior.
- Model-driven engineering can streamline the software development process but requires careful consideration of tool support and implementation feasibility.
