### Architectural Design Basics

- **Definition**: Architectural design involves organizing a software system and creating its overall structure.
- **Importance**: It links design with requirements engineering, identifying main structural components and their relationships.
- **Output**: The result is an architectural model describing the system as a set of communicating components.

### Agility and Architecture

- Early-stage agile processes include overall system architecture design.
- Refactoring the system architecture is costly as it impacts many components.

### Architectural Abstraction

- **Small Scale**: Focuses on the architecture of individual programs, decomposing them into components.
- **Large Scale**: Deals with complex enterprise systems, including programs and components distributed across different computers.

### Advantages of Explicit Architecture

- **Stakeholder Communication**: Acts as a discussion focus.
- **System Analysis**: Allows analysis of the system's ability to meet non-functional requirements.
- **Reuse**: Architectural components can be reused across various systems.

### Architectural Representations

- Commonly use block diagrams to show entities and relationships.
- Such diagrams are simple but lack detailed semantics and visible properties.

### Architectural Models Usage

- Facilitate system design discussions.
- Document an architecture with a complete system model showing components, interfaces, and connections.

### Architectural Design Decisions

- Creative process, varying with the system type.
- Common decisions influence non-functional characteristics like performance, security, safety, availability, and maintainability.

### Architectural Patterns

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separates presentation, interaction, and data management.
- **Layered Architecture**: Organizes system into layers with specific services.
- **Repository Architecture**: Central repository for data accessed by all system components.
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Distributes data and processing across clients and servers.
- **Pipe and Filter Architecture**: Sequential data processing through discrete transformations.

### Application Architectures

- Designed to meet organizational needs with common architectures reflecting application requirements.
- **Examples**: Data processing applications, transaction processing systems, event processing systems, and language processing systems.

### Summary

- A software architecture describes the organization of a system.
- Architectural design decisions cover application types, system distribution, and architectural styles.
- Architectures are documented from multiple perspectives like conceptual, logical, and process views.
