### Active voice and Passive voice

1. <span style="background:#b1ffff">Active voice:</span>
    - Subject performs the action
    - Format: <font color="#00c3ff">Subject + Verb + Object</font>
    - <font color="#ffff00">Example: "The cat chased the mouse."</font>
2. <span style="background:#fdbfff">Passive voice:</span>
    - Subject receives the action
    - Format: <font color="#00c3ff">Object + "to be" verb + Past Participle + (by Subject)</font>
    - <font color="#ffff00">Example: "The mouse was chased by the cat."</font>

Key differences:

- <font color="#ffc000">Active emphasizes the doer</font>
- <font color="#92d050">Passive emphasizes the receiver or action itself</font>
- Passive often uses "by" (though not always)

More examples:

Active: "John wrote the letter." 
Passive: "The letter was written by John."

Active: "They are building a house." 
Passive: "A house is being built (by them)."

Use active for clear, direct writing; use passive when the doer is unknown or unimportant.
